### Local.
Cow & Quince opened to provide local families and visitors access to the farm bounty that surrounds us in New Glarus. From the historic dairies and creameries to the newer organic farms, there is a diversity of food and farmstead products here in Green County and nearby communities. Come in for a meal and purchase some of the cheeses, jams, and other local items we use on our menu. We are always happy to share our knowledge of local farms and connect people with seasonal eating.

### Join.
Cow & Quince is the first community supported restaurant (CSR) in Green County. We are open to the public but there are benefits to becoming a member. Through your membership you invest in local farmers, reduce your carbon footprint, and have access to whole, sustainably raised foods.  To learn more about CSRs, please visit our page.

### Sustain.
Cow & Quince sources ingredients from local farms that utilize organic, sustainable practices. We strive to provide fresh ingredients and a seasonal menu. Be sure to check out our daily specials that take advantage of what is currently in season. 

### Direct sourcing
Direct trade is a form of sourcing practiced by some coffee roasters. Advocates of direct trade practices promote direct communication and price negotiation between buyer and farmer, along with systems that encourage and incentivize quality.

### Reinvest profits
We want to truly empower the communities that bring amazing coffee to you. Thatâ€™s why we reinvest 20% of our profits into farms, local businesses and schools everywhere our coffee is grown. You can see the communities grow and learn more about coffee farming on our blog.
