  title: Quick Covid Update
  description: >
All of us are living in the midst of uncertainty. Those of us who farm and feed people are part of an industry that is always vulnerable to changes in the weather and economy. In this current situation, more so than ever, with no end in sight, we are going to continue to cook for you until they tell us to stop. We are a very small, familial staff who takes great care in preparing the quality ingredients we purchase from our local farmers and cheesemakers. Food safety is always a priority for us. 

New Glarus was just emerging from the long, slow winter when this crisis hit. We are taking this time to re-assess our business model, utilizing our guiding principles and values of exclusive local sourcing of quality ingredients. To that end, we are in the midst of research and development on NY style bagels using local, organic, whole grain flours. We also have cupcakes and other baked specialties from our kitchen to help get you through. 
 
Check out our new online store for your opportunity to pre-order bagels and other baked goods. 
 
Food is medicine. We will continue to provide you with quality, locally sourced, wholesome food, prepared with love to feed you body and soul. 
 
Everyone take care, stay healthy.

   Located in a 1930’s historic building that formerly was a grocery store, Cow & Quince offers a farm-to-table experience in a casual atmosphere. We prepare many staples of our menu onsite including sauces, smoked meat, jams, desserts, and fermented delicacies.

        A great way to put up the seasonal harvests is adding it to ice cream. Come in and suggest a unique combination from Wisconsin fruits and herbs. Eat in or take a pint home.

  heading: Great coffee with no compromises
  description: >
    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
